#     REBIRTH OF AN ICON.

##     SOME THINGS GET EVEN BETTER WITH TIME.    

​                                             

​        At the turn of the nineties the shining light of one small car, one  that had been a mainstay of British classics, featured in countless UK  made films, driven by rock stars and beloved by the general public, was  beginning to dim. The dominance of MINI as a cultural icon and legendary small car was being challenged. Under its last owners, Mini had  increased its volume, yet suffered severe quality issues. So, while it  remained a beloved brand, it had lost a lot of its valuable image.

​        Focusing on substance and qualitative excellence, while carefully  refreshing its iconic design, Mini  relaunched as a premium brand in  2001 by BMW. Needless to say, the arrival of the re-invented MINI - now  in capital letters - had quite an impact. While retaining its original  spirit, MINI came back anew: as premium yet urban, impressive yet  thrillingly playful. The new MINI packed a new revved up and  ultra-polished punch to its iconic, classic, go-kart design. By staying  true to its legendary roots but completely re-interpreting them in a  fresh, modern way for the new millennium, MINI tapped into the zeitgeist once again.

​        Five cars subsequently evolved from the original iconic mini. Each  tailored to suit increasingly flexible demands and changing driving  habits of our discerning owners. The quintessential 3-door Hatch  combines unrivalled go-kart handling and lowered suspension, delivering a uniquely MINI thrill while navigating city streets. The ultra-sociable  5-door Hatch makes bringing friends along for the ride even more  inviting. With its rugged 4-wheel drive, The MINI Countryman broadens  horizons beyond city limits. The MINI Clubman embodies an iconic,  charming and sophisticated style, along with the MINI Convertible, which was made for sun lovers and thrill seekers alike who aren’t afraid of  standing out.         

And this small car with a big heart isn’t standing still. Modern  technology now seamlessly flows from its apps and interior features.
 With further developments coming down the pike, this little legend is just beginning its latest journey.
