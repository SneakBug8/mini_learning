# DON'T NEED A TITLE. MINI, INSPIRED BY ORIGINS.    

​    

##     MINI AUTOMOTIVE BRAND EXHIBITION – MILAN, ITALY.     

​                                             

The classic Mini not only changed the world of automotive and  design, but the whole meaning of urban mobility – and made it  contemporary. Sir Alec Issigonis thought developed a car that was  relevant to the times. It offered reduced fuel consumption and  ultra-compact dimensions, yet was spacious enough to accommodate four  passengers and their luggage. MINI presents "**D**on’t **N**eed **A** title. MINI, inspired by origins." It's a fascinating exhibition that  tells the story of one of the world's most important motoring icons.  Immerse yourself in the values that make up MINI's DNA, and take an  experiential journey through its past, present and future. The  exhibition epitomises iconic style, personality and creativity – just  like the MINI. The different rooms showcase its unique features, facets  and heritage. It is soon clear that you don't need a title, just the  name – MINI – to understand the origins of a legend.

###     MINI IN DESIGN.    

​    

MINI stands for design competence. It is synonymous for stylish  cars, stand-alone character and contemporary yet timeless design. From  reinventing our own design icon to collaborating with industry leaders,  design is the bond and bridge for everything we do. The MINI IN DESIGN  area places MINI in a greater design context by showcasing our creative  approaches and innovations.

###     PERSONALITIES.    

​    

MINI has always been more than a car. It's a mover. It's  understood, captured and driven the zeitgeist for decades. True  trailblazers always exhibit irreverent attitudes. MINI's bold defiance  still attracts creative personalities who become fervent ambassadors.  PERSONALITIES looks at the many cultural icons – like the Beatles and  Mary Quant – who've embodied the brand, and are still accompanying us on our journey.

###     MAKERS.

The attention to detail is intense.  MAKERS delves into the minds of people behind the production and gets  you up closer to their ideas, their passion and where they find  inspiration.
