#     WELCOME TO THE MINI UNIVERSE.

##     NOW AND THEN: WHAT MINI STANDS FOR.     

​                                             

​        MINI is a quintessentially urban brand. Starting in 1959 with the  first Mini, we have approached urban challenges with the view that we  could offer maximum experience with a minimal footprint.



The very first Mini, built in 1959, became a design icon, and had a  deeply human appeal: in its look, visceral driving experience and  accessibility. And it was invented as an answer to a pressing social  issue: an acute fuel shortage.

###     Changing the viewpoint.

​        This approach, of creative use of space and great, human-centric  design, informs everything we do: from the creation of exciting  automobiles to outstanding urban experiences. With its iconic design and thrilling go-kart feeling MINI disrupted the established small car  segment with every new car generation. While we stay faithful to our  legendary roots, we reinterpret them completely anew for each new  millennium with a portfolio of small statement cars for the urban  driver.



But we also look beyond cars. For us at MINI, it’s important to  understand the city as a whole, what’s most relevant to people’s lives – and what will matter to them in the future. This is why we deeply  engage in the fields of architecture, fashion and design. All fields  that matter to urban life.
